Welcome to my e-commerce store using the MERN stack.

This project has a CRUD operations via a cart component where the user can add items to the cart, update quantities, and delete items from the cart.

DESIGN
This app has a modern, neutral color scheme, meant to bring warmth. It uses a visible grid design and gigantic font to add some more fun and visual appeal.

CHALLENGES
I'm a very visual person and I know that the back-end is where the real work happens. I just like to put lots of energy into the front-end design and work from what I can see to what I don't see and bring them together that way.

Sometimes I wonder if I put too much emphasis on the design, but as long as the backend works properly, we can have pretty things to look at as well, so everyone wins. I just need to always make sure that I allot enough time to get the functionality together.

SOURCES
• Getting the logo to slowly appear in the top left corner of the Home page after scrolling a set number of pixels (230px):

I added a second "NavBar2" component for this to only happen on the Home page since there's already a gigantic logo there. However, when the user scrolls, that huge logo will scroll off-screen. Once it is no longer readable, the smaller logo will appear at the top left.
